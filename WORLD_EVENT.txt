1. how to trigger the event

The world event can be triggered by clicking mouse on the PApplet screen.

2. what should happen when the event is triggered

All neighboring points within the map and self point have their tiles become forest background if they are not already.
On click point a Slime Entity is spawned in, as well as the nearest Fairy into a "dumb" Fairy.


3. what the affected entities should do

The nearest Fairy entity becomes a "dumb Zombie". This Fairy entity's animation and action period is slowed down,
as well as it looks in the wrong direction (it's image becomes flipped with a boolean field dumb), and changes it pathing
strategy to be the SimplePathingStrategy.
4. what the new entity is and how it should behave

 The slime Entity is the new Entity introduced. The Slime entity uses the SimplePathingStrategy and meanders around the world.
